  abstract  = "Chronic liver disease is accompanied by multiple hematological
               abnormalities. Iron deficiency anemia is a frequent complication
               of advanced liver disease. The etiology is multifactorial,
               mostly due to chronic hemorrhage into the gastrointestinal
               tract. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is very
               challenging, as simple laboratory methods, including serum iron,
               ferritin, transferrin saturation (Tsat), and mean corpuscular
               volume are affected by the liver disease itself or the cause of
               the disease, resulting in difficulty in the interpretation of
               the results. Several new parameters, such as red blood cell
               ferritin, serum transferrin receptor test and index, and
               hepcidin, have been studied for their utility in indicating true
               iron deficiency in combination with chronic liver disease. Once
               iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed, it should be treated with
               oral or parenteral iron as well as portal pressure reducing
               drugs. Blood transfusion is reserved for symptomatic anemia
