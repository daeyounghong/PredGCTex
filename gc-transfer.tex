\abstract{\noindent\textbf{Background:}
Timely identification of individuals at elevated risk for gastric cancer (GC) within routine care could enable earlier endoscopy and referral.
We posit that cancers within the gastrointestinal/hepatopancreatobiliary spectrum share signals that can be leveraged via transfer learning on electronic health records (EHRs) variables.
%Early identification of gastric cancer (GC) risk from electronic health records (EHRs) could enable timelier endoscopy.
\textbf{Methods:}
We developed a cross-cancer transfer learning framework (Transfer) that pre-trains a multilayer perceptron (MLP) on non-GC gastrointestinal/hepatopancreatobiliary cancers (colorectal, esophageal, liver, pancreatic) and then adapts to GC using only structured variables from the de-identified MIMIC-IV v3.1 database. We compared transfer variants against strong non-transfer baselines (logistic regression, XGBoost, architecturally matched MLP) across decreasing GC label fractions to mimic data-scarce regimes. Primary endpoints were AUROC and average precision (AP); secondary endpoints included F1 and sensitivity/specificity.
\textbf{Results:}
In the full-label setting, Transfer achieved AUROC $0.854$ and AP $0.600$, outperforming logistic regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and improving over the scratch MLP in AUROC ($+0.024$) and F1 ($+0.027$), while AP was essentially tied (Transfer $0.600$ vs.\ MLP $0.603$).
As GC labels were reduced, Transfer maintained the strongest overall performance.
\textbf{Conclusions:}
Cross-cancer transfer on EHRs provides a generalizable, sample-efficient route to GC risk modeling—facilitating scalable deployment and helping prioritize endoscopic evaluation within routine workflows. By reusing related cancer cohorts to bootstrap GC representation learning, the approach strengthens early-risk identification under label scarcity and supports clinician decision-making at the point of care.}

\section{Introduction}
Gastric cancer (GC) continues to pose a major challenge to global health, 
ranking as the fifth most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide~\citep{park2024SHapley}. 
Prognosis remains strongly dependent on the stage at diagnosis, 
with 5-year survival rates exceeding 70\% for localized disease but dropping below 10\% for metastatic GC~\citep{NCI2023stomach}.

Harnessing routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data for earlier GC identification could improve outcomes by enabling timely endoscopy and treatment.
Structured EHR signals—such as demographics, diagnoses, and laboratory data—represent an attractive source for data-driven cancer screening~\citep{read2023cancers,huang2022jco}.
However, EHR-based model development can face persistent challenges, including incomplete or missing records, irregular sampling intervals, and the overall complexity of clinical documentation.
Moreover, ethical and regulatory requirements—such as institutional approvals or patient consent—can further limit the volume of analyzable data, 
leading to relatively small, heterogeneous datasets for model training.
% TODO: citation

For prediction of gastric cancer, machine learning models such as logistic regression, XGBoost, using routine and structured variables (e.g., demographics, diagnoses or common labs), have been investigated ~\citep{park2024SHapley,huang2022jco,Kim2024EHRGC}.
Despite these advances, most prior efforts optimize \emph{within-cancer} prediction and do not test whether \emph{cross-cancer} regularities in structured EHR signals (e.g., anemia/inflammation and metabolic axes) can be distilled and transferred to improve GC modeling under data scarcity.

Across gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) malignancies, multiple EHR-visible laboratory and clinical signatures overlap with those leveraged for GC detection. 
Luminal GI tract tumors often cause gradual occult bleeding that culminates in iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), producing characteristic shifts in longitudinal complete blood count (CBC) measures~\citep{read2023cancers,Aksoy2019CBC,Krieg2024IDA,Kim2014GIBleed}. 
In liver disease and primary liver cancer, anemia and systemic inflammation/nutritional markers (e.g., albumin, C-reactive protein, neutrophil–lymphocyte and platelet–lymphocyte ratios) are prominent and are also established biomarkers of GC prognosis~\citep{Stein2016Anemia,Gkamprela2017CLDIDA,Crumley2010Albumin,Kim2020Inflam}. 
Pancreatic cancer frequently perturbs glucose metabolism; dysglycemia and diabetes are associated with GC risk, suggesting that encoders exposed to glucose/HbA1c dynamics may learn representations transferable to GC without implying causation~\citep{Shimoyama2013DMGC,Yoon2013DMGC,Guo2022DMGC}. 
These cross-cancer regularities motivate leveraging non-GC cohorts to improve sample efficiency for GC modeling.

Deep learning (DL) provides a principled way to learn non-linear interactions from tabular EHR variables and to distill noisy laboratories into task-relevant representations. 
When labels for GC are limited, transfer learning and multi-task learning mitigate data scarcity by first inducing \emph{shared, cancer-agnostic representations} on related cancers and then adapting them to GC~\citep{Caruana1997_MTL,Pan2010_TLsurvey,Yosinski2014_transferable}. 
In this paradigm, DL functions primarily as a \emph{representation learner} that captures cross-cancer laboratory signatures expected to recur in GC, thereby improving sample efficiency and stability at adaptation time.

Accordingly, we aimed to investigate a cross-cancer transfer-learning paradigm with deep learning based on EHR data: we pre-train a shared multilayer-perceptron (MLP) backbone on non-gastric GI/HPB cancers using routinely collected EHR variables (demographics, diagnoses/ICD codes, and laboratory values) and then adapt it to GC via fine-tuning. 
We evaluate this hypothesis retrospectively in the MIMIC-IV v3.1 EHR database \citep{Johnson2024MIMICIV}, restricting inputs to structured EHR data available without using diagnostic endoscopy or pathology (i.e., no clinical notes), to minimize surveillance bias and label leakage.

%Our contributions are threefold:
%(i) a multi-head transfer MLP with structural-parameter (L2-SP) regularization \citep{li2018l2sp} and controllable fine-tuning heads (including logit averaging) to stabilize adaptation; and
%(ii) a rigorous, seed-repeated selection protocol that fixes model choice by validation AUROC and then reports both validation and held-out test metrics with sensitivity/specificity/F1 at a validation-optimized threshold \citep{davis2006relationship,saito2015precision}.

%To test this hypothesis, we developed a reproducible pipeline on the MIMIC-IV v3.1 database to construct cohorts, engineer biologically meaningful features, and train several baseline models along with a transfer-learning multilayer perceptron (Transfer-MLP). The Transfer-MLP is pretrained on non-GC GI cancers (colorectal, liver, esophageal, pancreatic) and then fine-tuned on GC labels using a controlled head-selection strategy and structural parameter (SP) regularization. Our contributions are: (i) a transparent, fully code-driven cohort construction and feature engineering workflow that avoids features merely encoding physicians' suspicion; (ii) a multi-head transfer architecture that supports different fine-tuning strategies; and (iii) an empirical demonstration that pretraining on related cancers improves early GC prediction compared with GC-only training.


\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Data Source and Ethics}
We used the publicly available de-identified MIMIC-IV clinical database (v3.1) \citep{Johnson2024MIMICIV}.
Access to the database was granted to our research team, and we adhered to all usage agreements, including the prohibition of data disclosure and misuse.

\subsection{Cohort Construction and Features}
In this study, we constructed cohorts not only for gastric cancer (GC) but also for multiple non-GC cancers (colorectal, esophageal, liver, and pancreatic).
This design emphasizes that our approach leverages diverse cancer types for pre-training before fine-tuning on GC.
Throughout, we use the notations to denote cancer types: \textbf{GC} = gastric cancer (target task), \textbf{CC} = colorectal cancer, \textbf{EC} = esophageal cancer, \textbf{LC} = liver cancer, and \textbf{PC} = pancreatic cancer.

% and sampled controls at a fixed $1{:}3$ case:control ratio, excluding subjects with the target cancer.

For each cancer, we identified cases by the earliest qualifying ICD-9/10 diagnosis.
We constructed features as follows.
For cases, we anchored on the admission during which the cancer was diagnosed.
Features include demographics (age, sex), binary ICD-derived comorbidity indicators (e.g., diabetes, GERD, ulcers) from the history up to and including the admission start date, and the oldest available values of routine laboratory tests (CBC/CMP) observed within the 730 days prior to (and including) the admission start date (or from all available records for controls).

We restricted inputs to routinely collected, structured EHR variables.
Feature selection was informed by prior gastric cancer–related studies~\citep{park2024SHapley,huang2022jco,Kim2024EHRGC} 
and guided by the principle of prioritizing routinely measured, low-burden variables with minimal missingness 
(e.g., complete blood count [CBC] and comprehensive metabolic panel [CMP] components).
\textbf{Demographics} comprised age and sex. 
\textbf{ICD-derived comorbidity indicators} (binary) included: diabetes mellitus; obesity; alcohol use disorder; current or prior tobacco use; gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); dyspepsia; peptic ulcer disease; chronic gastritis; documented \textit{Helicobacter pylori} infection; hypertension; history of myocardial infarction or angina; dyslipidemia/pure hypercholesterolemia; family history of cancer; protein–calorie malnutrition; post-hemorrhagic anemia; adverse effects of antineoplastic agents; dysphagia; receipt of antineoplastic chemotherapy; atrial fibrillation; iron-deficiency anemia; chronic kidney failure; coronary atherosclerosis/ischemic heart disease without angina; and hypo-osmolality/hyponatremia. 
\textbf{Laboratory features} consisted of complete blood count (CBC) indices and basic chemistries: hemoglobin; hematocrit; red blood cell count; white blood cell count; platelet count; mean corpuscular volume (MCV); mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH); mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC); red cell distribution width (RDW); leukocyte differential percentages (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils); sodium; potassium; chloride; bicarbonate; blood urea nitrogen; creatinine; glucose; and anion gap. 

%To address missing values, we applied median imputation based on the control population. 
%For each feature, the median value observed among the controls was calculated and substituted for missing entries across both cases and controls. 
%This strategy minimizes information leakage from the case group and provides a robust central tendency measure for imputation.

We then enforced a \emph{lab-complete inclusion criterion}: patients with any missing value in the required laboratory feature set were excluded prior to modeling.
For each cancer, controls were sampled at a fixed $1{:}3$ case:control ratio from patients without a diagnosis of the cancer (ever), and the same lab-complete criterion was applied to controls.
Identical preprocessing was applied to cases and controls; numerical features were standardized (z-scored) using statistics computed on the training split only.



%\subsection{Feature Engineering}
%We engineered features that are interpretable and clinically plausible. Demographics included age and sex. Binary ICD-derived comorbidity indicators were computed for clinically relevant conditions (e.g., diabetes, obesity, GERD, dyspepsia, gastric ulcer, alcohol/tobacco use, anemia, malnutrition, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, lipid disorders). For laboratory features, we included the most recent value per analyte within a symmetric look-back window around the index date (or all available values for controls), covering complete blood count indices and common chemistries (e.g., hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV/MCH/MCHC, WBC and differentials, platelets, RDW; sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, anion gap). Missing values were imputed and missingness flags optionally dropped after imputation. Non-predictive index-related variables were excluded from modeling.


\subsection{Models}
Our primary objective is to \textbf{quantify how much transfer learning from non-gastric cancers improves early prediction of gastric cancer (GC)}. 
We first introduce the \emph{transfer learning framework}, which pre-trains models on multiple non-GC cancers and subsequently fine-tunes them on GC.
We then describe the \emph{non-transfer baselines} trained solely on GC data for direct comparison.
To isolate the effect of transfer, we enforce identical feature sets, preprocessing steps, and stratified data splits across all methods.

\subsubsection{Transfer MLP}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ denote the set of \emph{non-gastric} cancers used for pretraining; in our main configuration, $\mathcal{C}=\{\CC,\EC,\LC,\PC\}$ (i.e., colorectal, esophageal, liver, and pancreatic cancers, respectively).
For each $c\in\mathcal{C}$, let $\mathcal{D}_c=\{(x_i^{(c)},y_i^{(c)})\}_{i=1}^{N_c}$ be the corresponding case--control dataset (identical feature space across $c$), constructed with a case--control ratio of $1{:}3$ (one case per three controls).
Here $y\in\{0,1\}$ indicates the disease status for cancer type $c$ ($y{=}1$ for \emph{case} with a confirmed diagnosis of type $c$, and $y{=}0$ for a \emph{control} without that diagnosis).

Our deep learning model consists of a shared backbone encoder $f_\phi:\mathbb{R}^{d_{\mathrm{in}}}\!\to\!\mathbb{R}^{d_h}$ with model parameters $\phi$ and cancer-specific linear heads $\{h_{\theta_c}\}_{c\in\mathcal{C}}$ acting on the latent representation $u=f_\phi(x)$ for input features $x$.
Each head with model parameters $\theta_c=(w_c,b_c)\in\mathbb{R}^{d_h}\times\mathbb{R}$ is an affine map parameterized as
\[
h_{\theta_c}(u)=\langle w_c,u\rangle + b_c,
\]
and produces a logit $z_c(x)=h_{\theta_c}(f_\phi(x))$.
The backbone encoder $f_\phi$ is a feed-forward network with linear blocks, batch normalization \citep{Ioffe2015_BN}, ReLU, and dropout~\citep{Srivastava2014_Dropout}.

We first define the class-weighted binary cross-entropy (BCE) used throughout.
Let $\sigma(t)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-t)}$ denote the logistic sigmoid.
Given a logit $z\in\mathbb{R}$ and a binary label $y\in\{0,1\}$, the per-sample loss is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:bce}
  \ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(z,y;\alpha)
  = -\,\alpha\,y\log \sigma(z)\;-\;(1-y)\log\!\big(1-\sigma(z)\big),
  \end{equation}
where $\alpha>0$ is the positive-class weight; in our experiments we set $\alpha=3$ to match the $1{:}3$ case--control sampling design.
%TODO: cite: class-weighted BCE?

During pretraining, we jointly optimize the backbone $f_\phi$ and all cancer-specific heads $\Theta_h\!=\!\{\theta_c\}_{c\in\mathcal{C}}$ by minimizing the mean of the weighted BCE over cancer types:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|}\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}}
  \ \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim\mathcal{D}_c}\!\big[\,\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(h_{\theta_c}(f_\phi(x)),y;\alpha)\,\big],
\end{equation}
with positive-class weight $\alpha{=}3$. 
To reduce overfitting, we applied standard $\ell_2$-regularization
(weight decay) with coefficient $\preDecayC$.
Thus, the pretraining objective is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pre_obj}
%  \min_{\phi,\Theta_h}\ 
  \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{pre}}(\phi,\Theta_h)
  = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|}\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}}
  \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim\mathcal{D}_c}\!\big[\,\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(h_{\theta_c}(f_\phi(x)),y;\alpha)\,\big]
  + \preDecayC \big( \|\phi\|_2^2 + \sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}} \|\theta_c\|_2^2 \big).
\end{equation}

In practice, model training does not update the parameters using the entire dataset at once, but rather processes smaller subsets of data called \emph{mini-batches}. 
A mini-batch is simply a small group of samples (e.g., a few dozen patients) drawn from the full dataset, and the model parameters are updated based on the gradient of the loss function computed by using only that group. 
This strategy reduces memory requirements and stabilizes optimization compared to using a single sample (stochastic updates) or the full dataset (full-batch updates).
During pretraining, at each optimization step we draw one mini-batch $B_c$ from \emph{each} cancer type $c\in\mathcal{C}$ and compute their respective losses. 
The pretraining loss for a step is then obtained by averaging over all cancer types:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pre_mix}
  \hat{\mathcal{L}}_{\mathrm{pre}}(\phi,\Theta_h)
  =\frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|}\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}}\ \frac{1}{|B_c|}\!
  \sum_{(x,y)\in B_c}\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(h_{\theta_c}(f_\phi(x)),y;\alpha) 
  + \preDecayC \Big( \|\phi\|_2^2 + \sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}} \|\theta_c\|_2^2 \Big).
\end{equation}
In this way, each cancer-specific head $h_{\theta_c}$ is trained using its own mini-batch, while the backbone encoder $f_\phi$ receives gradients aggregated across cancers, encouraging it to learn shared representations.

\textit{Expected effect.} Type-balanced, multi-task pretraining (\cref{eq:pre_obj,eq:pre_mix}) is expected to (i) induce cancer-agnostic risk representations in $f_\phi$, (ii) improve sample efficiency and stabilize optimization when fine-tuning on gastric cancer with limited labels, and (iii) mitigate label-imbalance effects through the weighted loss in \cref{eq:bce}.
These mechanisms are consistent with established benefits of multi-task learning and transfer learning~\citep{Caruana1997_MTL,Pan2010_TLsurvey,Yosinski2014_transferable,He2009_Imbalanced}.

For training the prediction model for GC, we introduce new GC linear head $\head{\GC}:\mathbb{R}^{d_{h}}\!\to\!\mathbb{R}$ whose model parameters $\headP{\GC}$ are randomly initialized.
For input features $x$, by using the pretrained backbone encoder $\enc{\encP}$, the probability of GC is predicted by applying the sigmoid function $\sigma$ to the logit $\head{\GC}(\enc{\encP}(x))$ (i.e., $\sigma(\head{\GC}(\enc{\encP}(x)))$).
Let $\pretrainP$ denote the pretrained model parameters of backbone encoder.
For fine-tuning, we first initialize the model parameters of backbone $\encP$ to $\pretrainP$, and then jointly optimize the backbone $\enc{\encP}$ and the GC head $\head{\GC}$ by minimizing the weighted BCE for the GC dataset:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ft_obj}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ft}}(\phi,\headP{\GC}) = \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim \mathcal{D}_{\GC}}\!\big[\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(\head{\GC}(\enc{\pretrainP}(x)),y;\alpha)\big]\;+\;\ftDecayC \big( \|\phi\|_2^2 + \|\headP{\GC}\|_2^2 \big),
\end{equation}
where we use positive-class weight $\alpha{=}3$ and $\ftDecayC$ is the $\ell_2$-regularization coefficient for fine-tuning.

%% TODO: cite Adam
%For pretraining and fine-tuning phases, we optimize model parameters using the Adam optimizer with separate learning rates and $\ell_2$-regularization coefficients $\preDecayC$ and $\ftDecayC$.
%The mini-batch size is set to $\lfloor 0.2 \cdot N_c \rfloor$ capped to $[8,64]$ where $N_c$ is the data size for cancer type $c \in \{\CC,\EC,\LC,\PC,\GC\}$.
%All tasks share the positive-class weight $\alpha = 3$ in $\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}$.

%\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Baselines (Non-transfer)}
We benchmark three widely used non-transfer families that reflect complementary inductive biases for structured EHR data \citep{EHRBreastRecurrence2023,WANG2023Prostate,park2024SHapley}. To avoid conflating modeling choices with pretraining, all baselines use the identical feature set, preprocessing, and stratified data splits as the Transfer MLP.

\subparagraph{Logistic Regression (LR)}
A linear probabilistic classifier that models the log-odds of GC as an affine function of the inputs, offering a strong, interpretable tabular baseline. LR captures additive effects and provides well-calibrated risk estimates under mild assumptions, making it a common comparator in clinical prediction studies.

\subparagraph{eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)}
An ensemble of decision trees trained by gradient boosting to approximate non-linear decision boundaries and higher-order feature interactions on tabular data. This class of models is competitive on EHR tasks due to its flexibility with mixed-scale features and robustness to outliers and sparse signals.

\subparagraph{MLP trained from scratch (MLP)}
To isolate the effect of transfer learning, we also evaluate a multilayer perceptron that is \emph{architecturally identical} to the Transfer MLP’s backbone and GC head (linear blocks with batch normalization, ReLU, and dropout), and uses the \emph{same} training objective, mini-batch formulation, and regularization as in fine-tuning. The only difference is that the pretraining stage on non-GC cancer datasets is \emph{omitted}: all parameters are randomly initialized and optimized solely on the GC dataset. Conceptually, this baseline serves as an \emph{ablation} of the Transfer MLP in which the pretraining component is removed; thus, any performance gap directly quantifies the benefit of transfer.


\subsection{Statistical Analysis}
%In imbalanced settings, AP is often more informative than AUROC~\citep{Saito2015_PR}.
For each cancer type, we first divided the subjects into training and test sets, using an 85\%--15\% split. 
We further split the training set so that 20\% of it was used as a validation set. 
In all splits, stratified sampling was performed to ensure that the proportion of cases and controls remained consistent across the training, validation, and test sets. 
For a given hyperparameter setting, we trained model parameters using the training set, and computed the model performances for the validation and test sets. 
The evaluation metrics included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), average precision (AP), sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. 
This entire procedure was repeated 10 times with different data splits. 
To optimize hyperparameters, we computed the mean AUROC on the validation set across these repetitions and selected hyperparameters based on this mean AUROC. 
The final model performance was then evaluated on the independent test split, and we report the mean performance across the 10 repetitions as the final test result. 

Metrics such as AUROC and average precision (AP) were computed directly from the continuous prediction scores without applying any threshold. 
For threshold-dependent measures, operating points were determined using the validation split and then applied to the independent test split. 
Specifically, the threshold for the F1-score was chosen as the point that maximized the validation F1, and this same threshold was used to compute the F1-score on the test set. 
For sensitivity and specificity, following the approach in \citep{read2023cancers}, we selected the threshold that provided the best balance between the two metrics—that is, the point on the validation receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve that was closest to the ideal classification point representing 100\% sensitivity and 0\% false-positive rate. 
All reported sensitivity and specificity values on the test set were based on this validation-derived threshold.

\end{table}
We constructed case--control cohorts for GC (target) and four source cancers (CC, EC, LC, PC) at a 1:3 ratio.
Table~\ref{tab:cohort} summarizes sample sizes and demographics.
Across cohorts, the sex distribution was approximately balanced overall (weighted mean $\approx$50\% male), and age medians clustered around the late 50s (57--60 years) with interquartile ranges spanning roughly the early 40s to the early 70s.
Within the pretraining pool, EC constitutes the smallest cohort (364 cases, 1{,}092 controls), whereas PC provides the largest case count (1{,}467), followed by LC (1{,}432) and CC (1{,}296).
In aggregate, the non-GC sources contribute 4{,}559 cases and 13{,}677 controls (total 18{,}236), compared with 508 and 1{,}524 for GC (total 2{,}032); thus, the pretraining pool supplies about $9\times$ more labeled samples than the GC task alone, a scale difference pertinent for transfer learning before adaptation to GC.

\end{table}
As summarized in Table~\ref{tab:model-compare-gc1}, the Transfer model achieved the highest discrimination and the strongest overall operating profile on the full-label setting.
Transfer obtained the top AUROC ($0.854$) and the highest F1 ($0.636$), with the best specificity ($0.786$).
Average precision (AP) was comparable to the scratch MLP (Transfer $0.600$ vs.\ MLP $0.603$) and higher than LR ($0.518$) and XGB ($0.549$).
Sensitivity for the MLP ($0.782$) slightly exceeded that of Transfer ($0.768$).
Overall, relative to the scratch MLP, Transfer improved AUROC by $+0.024$ and F1 by $+0.027$ (and specificity by $+0.048$), at the cost of a marginally lower AP ($-0.003$), indicating that pretraining on related non-GC cancers yields more informative representations for GC risk despite a small AP trade-off.

As summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:model-gcrate} (AUROC, AP, and F1 panels), we varied the \emph{GC sampling rate} $r \in \{1.00, 0.50, 0.20, 0.10\}$ to quantify robustness under limited GC labels.
For each $r$, we applied stratified sampling at proportion $r$ on the GC training partition (preserving the case{:}control ratio), while keeping the GC validation and test partitions fixed.
Non-GC source datasets for pretraining and all preprocessing were unchanged across $r$.
All models (LR, XGB, MLP-from-scratch, and Transfer) were then trained on the resulting $r$-subsampled GC training set for that rate.
The Transfer model always used the same pretraining configuration on non-GC cancers and was fine-tuned on the $r$-subsampled GC training set.

As $r$ decreases, all models show the expected degradation in AUROC, AP, and F1 due to reduced sample size (see Figure~\ref{fig:model-gcrate}).
Across all rates, the Transfer model maintains the best discrimination and precision--recall performance, with the absolute gains most pronounced at the smallest $r$.
These findings indicate that pretraining on related non-GC cancers consistently improves GC risk modeling across a wide range of labeled-data regimes, with the largest improvements in AP and F1 under the scarcest-label settings.
%At \texttt{gc\_rate}$=0.01$, Transfer achieves AUROC~0.916 and AP~0.765, surpassing the scratch MLP (AUROC~0.813, AP~0.546) by $+0.103$ AUROC and $+0.219$ AP, and yielding the highest F1 (0.715 vs.\ 0.600; $+0.115$).
%The advantage remains substantial at \texttt{gc\_rate}$=0.02$ (AUROC $+0.075$, AP $+0.165$, F1 $+0.088$) and \texttt{gc\_rate}$=0.05$ (AUROC $+0.058$, AP $+0.133$, F1 $+0.085$). 

%With more abundant labels, the gap narrows but persists.
%At \texttt{gc\_rate}$=0.10$, Transfer improves over MLP by $+0.040$ AUROC, $+0.097$ AP, and $+0.048$ F1; at \texttt{gc\_rate}$=0.50$, the corresponding margins are $+0.013$, $+0.027$, and $+0.027$; and at \texttt{gc\_rate}$=1.00$, Transfer still leads (AUROC 0.938 vs.\ 0.930; AP 0.826 vs.\ 0.811; F1 0.751 vs.\ 0.735).
%Notably, AUROC is relatively robust to prevalence, yet non-transfer models degrade markedly at \texttt{gc\_rate}$\le 0.05$, whereas Transfer retains higher AUROC (0.916--0.924) and substantially higher AP (0.765--0.787).

To examine how pretraining source composition influences transfer performance,
we repeated pretraining using one source cancer at a time and compared the results
to the model pretrained on all four non-GC cancers (CC, EC, LC, PC).
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:transfer-by-pretrain-types}, single–source transfer models achieved
AUROC values in the 0.828–0.841 range and F1 in the 0.594–0.632 range, with AP between 0.544 and 0.578.
Among the single sources, \textbf{CC} yielded the highest F1 (0.632), while \textbf{EC} gave the highest AP (0.578).
The multi–source model using \textbf{CC+EC+LC+PC} achieved the best overall operating profile
(AUROC 0.854, F1 0.636) and an AP of 0.600.
These results suggest that combining heterogeneous sources offers a modest but consistent benefit in discrimination and overall operating balance.
While the multi-source model performed best in this experiment, 
we do not claim that this combination is universally optimal. 
Instead, these findings suggest that leveraging multiple heterogeneous source cancers 
can provide complementary EHR-visible signals, 
and that carefully balancing or selecting diverse sources 
offers potential to further improve generalization for gastric cancer prediction.

We investigated whether a pretrained backbone should remain fixed during adaptation to gastric cancer (GC) or be allowed to update. Although our pretraining sources (CC/EC/LC/PC) are related to GC, their feature distributions and label–feature couplings are not identical; some degree of source-to-target shift is therefore expected. In such settings, transfer learning and multi-task learning can confer advantages by first inducing shared, cancer-agnostic representations and then adapting them to the target task \citep{Caruana1997_MTL,Pan2010_TLsurvey,Yosinski2014_transferable}. The practical question, however, is whether adaptation should occur only in a newly introduced GC head (with the backbone frozen; \emph{FT-Head}) or across all layers (with the backbone unfrozen; \emph{FT-Full}).

To answer this, we compared FT-Head and FT-Full across GC training-label rates $r \in \{1.00, 0.50, 0.20, 0.10\}$: \emph{FT-Head}, which freezes the pretrained backbone and trains only a new linear GC head, and \emph{FT-Full}, which jointly fine-tunes the backbone and the GC head. Both variants shared the same pretraining on CC+EC+LC+PC, identical features, preprocessing, and stratified splits. 
Figure~\ref{fig:transfer-combo-gcrate} summarizes discrimination and precision–recall performance.
Overall, \textbf{full fine-tuning (FT-Full) outperformed freezing (FT-Head) at every label fraction}, with larger gains as more GC supervision was available.

These results are consistent with two complementary mechanisms. First, allowing the backbone to update helps realign the shared representation to GC-specific covariances, improving ranking and precision–recall when the target signal is sufficiently informative \citep{Pan2010_TLsurvey,Yosinski2014_transferable}. Second, when labels are extremely scarce, freezing the backbone reduces the effective degrees of freedom, tempering variance and occasionally narrowing the gap on threshold-sensitive metrics, even if overall discrimination remains similar.

In light of the observed margins at moderate-to-higher label availability and for conceptual consistency, we use \emph{FT-Full as the primary transfer setting}, using FT-Head as an ablation to quantify the value of updating the representation during adaptation.

\section{Discussion}
In this retrospective study using de-identified structured EHR data from MIMIC-IV v3.1~\citep{Johnson2024MIMICIV}, a transfer learning strategy that pre-trains a multilayer perceptron on non-gastric cancers (CC/EC/LC/PC) and then adapts to GC achieved the best overall performance among strong non-transfer baselines. On the full GC label regime ($r{=}1.00$), Transfer attained the highest AUROC and F1 (Table~\ref{tab:model-compare-gc1}); AP was essentially tied with the scratch MLP (Transfer $0.600$ vs.\ MLP $0.603$).
When we progressively reduced GC training labels ($r\!\downarrow$), Transfer preserved a consistent AUROC advantage and typically higher AP—with the largest margins under the scarcest labels (Figure~\ref{fig:model-gcrate}; e.g., at $r{=}0.10$, Transfer vs.\ scratch MLP: AUROC $0.827$ vs.\ $0.745$, AP $0.560$ vs.\ $0.453$, F1 $0.589$ vs.\ $0.516$).
We also observed that full fine-tuning generally outperformed frozen-backbone adaptation once modest GC supervision was available, while freezing remained competitive at the most extreme data scarcity (Figure~\ref{fig:transfer-combo-gcrate}).
Finally, varying the composition of pretraining sources showed that combining four sources (CC+EC+LC+PC) produced the best overall performance—raising AUROC and F1 over the scratch MLP and yielding an AP essentially on par with it (Table~\ref{tab:transfer-by-pretrain-types}).

Our findings align with prior observations that risk signals visible in structured EHR data recur across GI/HPB malignancies and therefore can act as transferable supervision for GC~\citep{read2023cancers,Aksoy2019CBC,Krieg2024IDA,Kim2014GIBleed,Stein2016Anemia,Gkamprela2017CLDIDA,Crumley2010Albumin,Shimoyama2013DMGC,Yoon2013DMGC,Guo2022DMGC}. While earlier GC prediction efforts have largely optimized within-cancer models using routine variables~\citep{park2024SHapley,huang2022jco,Kim2024EHRGC}, our results suggest that cross-cancer pretraining helps distill cancer-agnostic representations from noisy labs and comorbidities, which then transfer to GC with improved sample efficiency. This is consistent with established benefits of multi-task and transfer learning on related tasks~\citep{Caruana1997_MTL,Pan2010_TLsurvey,Yosinski2014_transferable}.

We hypothesize three complementary mechanisms behind the observed gains:
(i) \textit{representation sharing}—pretraining encourages the backbone to encode recurring EHR patterns that GC also exhibits;
(ii) \textit{regularization under scarcity}—pretraining reduces the effective hypothesis space, aiding generalization when GC labels are limited;
and (iii) \textit{optimization stability}—a pretrained initialization improves convergence to better optima compared with training from scratch. The superiority of full fine-tuning over freezing at moderate data availability suggests that some GC-specific re-alignment of shared features is beneficial, whereas freezing can mitigate variance when labels are extremely scarce, producing similar discrimination with fewer trainable degrees of freedom. These observations match classic transfer learning trade-offs between bias and variance~\citep{Pan2010_TLsurvey,Yosinski2014_transferable}.

%All single-source pretraining choices (CC, EC, LC, PC) provided meaningful improvements over GC-only training, and combining all four delivered the strongest overall results (Table~\ref{tab:transfer-by-pretrain-types}).
Compared to single-source pretraining choices (CC, EC, LC, PC), combining all four pretraining choices delivered the strongest overall balance—improving AUROC and F1 versus scratch and yielding an AP essentially on par with it (Table~\ref{tab:transfer-by-pretrain-types}).
These results imply that (i) each source cancer contributes overlapping but not identical EHR-visible signals; and (ii) diversity across sources can add incremental value. We do not claim that our specific mix is universally optimal; rather, our results motivate future work on principled source selection and weighting schemes that account for relatedness, cohort size, and label quality.

From a clinical standpoint, these models are not intended to replace diagnostic endoscopy but to prioritize patients for timely evaluation and follow-up. Earlier identification of higher-risk patients in routine care could shorten time-to-endoscopy and facilitate detection at more treatable stages, where survival is markedly better~\citep{NCI2023stomach}. The transfer framework is appealing for institutions with few confirmed GC cases but access to other GI/HPB cancer cohorts; pretraining on related cancers can “borrow strength” and stabilize GC performance without requiring specialized data modalities or free-text notes, potentially reducing surveillance bias and label leakage.

This study has several limitations.
First, MIMIC-IV is a single-center U.S. dataset derived largely from inpatient encounters; external validity to outpatient or multi-institutional settings remains unproven~\citep{Johnson2024MIMICIV}.
Second, cases were indexed by the first GC diagnosis code, and laboratory features were defined as the \emph{oldest} available values within the 730 days preceding (and including) the index admission start date for cases (and across the full record for controls).
While this policy reduces peri-diagnostic bias relative to using recent values, it also collapses longitudinal information into single snapshots and may discard informative dynamics.
Moreover, restricting to a lab-complete cohort may introduce selection bias toward patients with more complete testing, potentially limiting generalizability to settings with sparser laboratory coverage.
Finally, we did not evaluate subgroup fairness (e.g., by age, sex, or race/ethnicity) or conduct a full calibration analysis.

Several extensions appear promising.
(i) Move beyond static features to longitudinal encoders that incorporate trends, rates of change, and testing frequency~\citep{DeepEHR}.
(ii) Combine supervised multi-task pretraining with self-supervised objectives on large unlabeled EHR (e.g., masked feature modeling) to further improve sample efficiency. 
(iii) Explore domain adaptation and source reweighting to mitigate negative transfer when source–target mismatch is large.
(iv) Expand external validation across health systems and prospective cohorts, with prevalence-aware calibration and decision-analytic evaluation.
%(v) Incorporate interpretability (e.g., post hoc attribution) to facilitate clinical review and identify spurious signals~\citep{park2024SHapley}.

\section{Conclusions}
By pretraining a shared encoder on related GI/HPB cancers and adapting it to gastric cancer (GC) using only routine and structured EHR variables,
this study advances a generalizable and sample‑efficient route to cancer risk modeling under label scarcity.
Because it operates on data already collected in routine care, the approach can be embedded into EHR workflows to prioritize timely endoscopy referrals, and target follow‑up in resource‑constrained settings—aligning with the broader role of AI as clinician decision support in acute care. 
Before any clinical use, external multi‑site validation and prevalence‑aware calibration remain essential; nonetheless, the framework offers a practical blueprint for repurposing heterogeneous cancer cohorts to bootstrap GC models and, more broadly, a reusable foundation for early‑risk identification in other underrepresented cancers.
