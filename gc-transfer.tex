\section{Introduction}
Gastric cancer (GC) continues to pose a major challenge to global health, 
ranking as the fifth most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide~\citep{park2024SHapley}. 
Prognosis remains strongly dependent on the stage at diagnosis, 
with 5-year survival rates exceeding 70\% for localized disease but dropping below 10\% for metastatic GC~\citep{NCI2023stomach}.

Harnessing routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data for earlier GC identification could improve outcomes by enabling timely endoscopy and treatment.
Structured EHR signals—such as demographics, diagnoses, and laboratory data—represent an attractive source for data-driven cancer screening~\citep{read2023cancers,huang2022jco}.
However, EHR-based model development can face persistent challenges, including incomplete or missing records, irregular sampling intervals, and the overall complexity of clinical documentation.
Moreover, ethical and regulatory requirements—such as institutional approvals or patient consent—can further limit the volume of analyzable data, 
leading to relatively small, heterogeneous datasets for model training.
% TODO: citation

For prediction of gastric cancer, machine learning models such as logistic regression, XGBoost, using routine and structured variables (e.g., demographics, diagnoses or common labs), have been investigated ~\citep{park2024SHapley,huang2022jco,Kim2024EHRGC}.
Despite these advances, most prior efforts optimize \emph{within-cancer} prediction and do not test whether \emph{cross-cancer} regularities in structured EHR signals (e.g., anemia/inflammation and metabolic axes) can be distilled and transferred to improve GC modeling under data scarcity.

Across gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) malignancies, multiple EHR-visible laboratory and clinical signatures overlap with those leveraged for GC detection. 
Luminal GI tract tumors often cause gradual occult bleeding that culminates in iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), producing characteristic shifts in longitudinal complete blood count (CBC) measures~\citep{read2023cancers,Aksoy2019CBC,Krieg2024IDA,Kim2014GIBleed}. 
In liver disease and primary liver cancer, anemia and systemic inflammation/nutritional markers (e.g., albumin, C-reactive protein, neutrophil–lymphocyte and platelet–lymphocyte ratios) are prominent and are also established biomarkers of GC prognosis~\citep{Stein2016Anemia,Gkamprela2017CLDIDA,Crumley2010Albumin,Kim2020Inflam}. 
Pancreatic cancer frequently perturbs glucose metabolism; dysglycemia and diabetes are associated with GC risk, suggesting that encoders exposed to glucose/HbA1c dynamics may learn representations transferable to GC without implying causation~\citep{Shimoyama2013DMGC,Yoon2013DMGC,Guo2022DMGC}. 
These cross-cancer regularities motivate leveraging non-GC cohorts to improve sample efficiency for GC modeling.

Deep learning (DL) provides a principled way to learn non-linear interactions from tabular EHR variables and to distill noisy laboratories into task-relevant representations. 
When labels for GC are limited, transfer learning (TL) and multi-task learning (MTL) mitigate data scarcity by first inducing \emph{shared, cancer-agnostic representations} on related cancers and then adapting them to GC~\citep{Caruana1997_MTL,Pan2010_TLsurvey,Yosinski2014_transferable}. 
In this paradigm, DL functions primarily as a \emph{representation learner} that captures cross-cancer laboratory signatures expected to recur in GC, thereby improving sample efficiency and stability at adaptation time.

Accordingly, we aimed to investigate a cross-cancer transfer-learning paradigm with deep learning based on EHR data: we pre-train a shared multilayer-perceptron (MLP) backbone on non-gastric GI/HPB cancers using routinely collected EHR variables (demographics, diagnoses/ICD codes, and laboratory values) and then adapt it to GC via fine-tuning. 
We evaluate this hypothesis retrospectively in the MIMIC-IV v3.1 EHR database \citep{Johnson2024MIMICIV}, restricting inputs to structured EHR data available without using diagnostic endoscopy or pathology (i.e., no clinical notes), to minimize surveillance bias and label leakage.

%Our contributions are threefold:
%(i) a multi-head transfer MLP with structural-parameter (L2-SP) regularization \citep{li2018l2sp} and controllable fine-tuning heads (including logit averaging) to stabilize adaptation; and
%(ii) a rigorous, seed-repeated selection protocol that fixes model choice by validation AUROC and then reports both validation and held-out test metrics with sensitivity/specificity/F1 at a validation-optimized threshold \citep{davis2006relationship,saito2015precision}.

%To test this hypothesis, we developed a reproducible pipeline on the MIMIC-IV v3.1 database to construct cohorts, engineer biologically meaningful features, and train several baseline models along with a transfer-learning multilayer perceptron (Transfer-MLP). The Transfer-MLP is pretrained on non-GC GI cancers (colorectal, liver, esophageal, pancreatic) and then fine-tuned on GC labels using a controlled head-selection strategy and structural parameter (SP) regularization. Our contributions are: (i) a transparent, fully code-driven cohort construction and feature engineering workflow that avoids features merely encoding physicians' suspicion; (ii) a multi-head transfer architecture that supports different fine-tuning strategies; and (iii) an empirical demonstration that pretraining on related cancers improves early GC prediction compared with GC-only training.


\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Data Source and Ethics}
We used the publicly available de-identified MIMIC-IV clinical database (v3.1) \citep{Johnson2024MIMICIV}.
Access to the database was granted to our research team, and we adhered to all usage agreements, including the prohibition of data disclosure and misuse.

\subsection{Cohort Construction and Features}
In this study, we constructed cohorts not only for gastric cancer (GC) but also for multiple non-GC cancers (colorectal, esophageal, liver, and pancreatic).
This design emphasizes that our approach leverages diverse cancer types for pre-training before fine-tuning on GC.
Throughout, we use the notations to denote cancer types: \textbf{GC} = gastric cancer (target task), \textbf{CC} = colorectal cancer, \textbf{EC} = esophageal cancer, \textbf{LC} = liver cancer, and \textbf{PC} = pancreatic cancer.

For each cancer, we identified cases by the earliest qualifying ICD-9/10 diagnosis and sampled controls at a fixed $1{:}3$ case:control ratio, excluding subjects with the target cancer.
The GC index time $t_G$ is the first GC diagnosis; for non-GC cancers $c\in\{\mathrm{CC},\mathrm{EC},\mathrm{LC},\mathrm{PC}\}$ we analogously define $t_c$.
Features include demographics (age, sex), binary ICD-derived comorbidity indicators (e.g., diabetes, GERD, ulcers), and the most recent values of routine laboratory tests (CMP/CBC) in a $\pm 30$-day window around the index time (or all available values for controls).
Identical preprocessing is applied to cases and controls; numerical features are standardized by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance using statistics on the training split only.

To address missing values, we applied median imputation based on the control population. 
For each feature, the median value observed among the controls was calculated and substituted for missing entries across both cases and controls. 
This strategy minimizes information leakage from the case group and provides a robust central tendency measure for imputation.
%TODO: finally used feature list



%\subsection{Feature Engineering}
%We engineered features that are interpretable and clinically plausible. Demographics included age and sex. Binary ICD-derived comorbidity indicators were computed for clinically relevant conditions (e.g., diabetes, obesity, GERD, dyspepsia, gastric ulcer, alcohol/tobacco use, anemia, malnutrition, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, lipid disorders). For laboratory features, we included the most recent value per analyte within a symmetric look-back window around the index date (or all available values for controls), covering complete blood count indices and common chemistries (e.g., hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV/MCH/MCHC, WBC and differentials, platelets, RDW; sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, anion gap). Missing values were imputed and missingness flags optionally dropped after imputation. Non-predictive index-related variables were excluded from modeling.


\subsection{Models}
Our primary objective is to \textbf{quantify how much transfer learning from non-gastric cancers improves early prediction of gastric cancer (GC)}. 
We first introduce the \emph{transfer learning framework}, which pre-trains models on multiple non-GC cancers and subsequently fine-tunes them on GC.
We then describe the \emph{non-transfer baselines} trained solely on GC data for direct comparison.
To isolate the effect of transfer, we enforce identical feature sets, preprocessing steps, and stratified data splits across all methods.

\subsubsection{Transfer MLP}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ denote the set of \emph{non-gastric} cancers used for pretraining; in our main configuration, $\mathcal{C}=\{\CC,\EC,\LC,\PC\}$ (i.e., colorectal, esophageal, liver, and pancreatic cancers, respectively).
For each $c\in\mathcal{C}$, let $\mathcal{D}_c=\{(x_i^{(c)},y_i^{(c)})\}_{i=1}^{N_c}$ be the corresponding case--control dataset (identical feature space across $c$), constructed with a case--control ratio of $1{:}3$ (one case per three controls).
Here $y\in\{0,1\}$ indicates the disease status for cancer type $c$ ($y{=}1$ for \emph{case} with a confirmed diagnosis of type $c$, and $y{=}0$ for a \emph{control} without that diagnosis).

Our deep learning model consists of a shared backbone encoder $f_\phi:\mathbb{R}^{d_{\mathrm{in}}}\!\to\!\mathbb{R}^{d_h}$ with model parameters $\phi$ and cancer-specific linear heads $\{h_{\theta_c}\}_{c\in\mathcal{C}}$ acting on the latent representation $u=f_\phi(x)$ for input features $x$.
Each head with model parameters $\theta_c=(w_c,b_c)\in\mathbb{R}^{d_h}\times\mathbb{R}$ is an affine map parameterized as
\[
h_{\theta_c}(u)=\langle w_c,u\rangle + b_c,
\]
and produces a logit $z_c(x)=h_{\theta_c}(f_\phi(x))$.
The backbone encoder $f_\phi$ is a feed-forward network with linear blocks, batch normalization \citep{Ioffe2015_BN}, ReLU, and dropout~\citep{Srivastava2014_Dropout}.

We first define the class-weighted binary cross-entropy (BCE) used throughout.
Let $\sigma(t)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-t)}$ denote the logistic sigmoid.
Given a logit $z\in\mathbb{R}$ and a binary label $y\in\{0,1\}$, the per-sample loss is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:bce}
  \ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(z,y;\alpha)
  = -\,\alpha\,y\log \sigma(z)\;-\;(1-y)\log\!\big(1-\sigma(z)\big),
  \end{equation}
where $\alpha>0$ is the positive-class weight; in our experiments we set $\alpha=3$ to match the $1{:}3$ case--control sampling design.
%TODO: cite: class-weighted BCE?

During pretraining, we jointly optimize the backbone $f_\phi$ and all cancer-specific heads $\Theta_h\!=\!\{\theta_c\}_{c\in\mathcal{C}}$ by minimizing the mean of the weighted BCE over cancer types:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|}\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}}
  \ \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim\mathcal{D}_c}\!\big[\,\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(h_{\theta_c}(f_\phi(x)),y;\alpha)\,\big],
\end{equation}
with positive-class weight $\alpha{=}3$. 
To reduce overfitting, we applied standard $\ell_2$-regularization
(weight decay) with coefficient $\preDecayC$.
Thus, the pretraining objective is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pre_obj}
%  \min_{\phi,\Theta_h}\ 
  \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{pre}}(\phi,\Theta_h)
  = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|}\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}}
  \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim\mathcal{D}_c}\!\big[\,\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(h_{\theta_c}(f_\phi(x)),y;\alpha)\,\big]
  + \preDecayC \big( \|\phi\|_2^2 + \sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}} \|\theta_c\|_2^2 \big).
\end{equation}

In practice, model training does not update the parameters using the entire dataset at once, but rather processes smaller subsets of data called \emph{mini-batches}. 
A mini-batch is simply a small group of samples (e.g., a few dozen patients) drawn from the full dataset, and the model parameters are updated based on the gradient of the loss function computed by using only that group. 
This strategy reduces memory requirements and stabilizes optimization compared to using a single sample (stochastic updates) or the full dataset (full-batch updates).
During pretraining, at each optimization step we draw one mini-batch $B_c$ from \emph{each} cancer type $c\in\mathcal{C}$ and compute their respective losses. 
The pretraining loss for a step is then obtained by averaging over all cancer types:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pre_mix}
  \hat{\mathcal{L}}_{\mathrm{pre}}(\phi,\Theta_h)
  =\frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|}\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}}\ \frac{1}{|B_c|}\!
  \sum_{(x,y)\in B_c}\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(h_{\theta_c}(f_\phi(x)),y;\alpha) 
  + \preDecayC \Big( \|\phi\|_2^2 + \sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}} \|\theta_c\|_2^2 \Big).
\end{equation}
In this way, each cancer-specific head $h_{\theta_c}$ is trained using its own mini-batch, while the backbone encoder $f_\phi$ receives gradients aggregated across cancers, encouraging it to learn shared representations.

\textit{Expected effect.} Type-balanced, multi-task pretraining (\cref{eq:pre_obj,eq:pre_mix}) is expected to (i) induce cancer-agnostic risk representations in $f_\phi$, (ii) improve sample efficiency and stabilize optimization when fine-tuning on gastric cancer with limited labels, and (iii) mitigate label-imbalance effects through the weighted loss in \cref{eq:bce}.
These mechanisms are consistent with established benefits of multi-task learning and transfer learning~\citep{Caruana1997_MTL,Pan2010_TLsurvey,Yosinski2014_transferable,He2009_Imbalanced}.

For training the prediction model for GC, we introduce new GC linear head $\head{\GC}:\mathbb{R}^{d_{h}}\!\to\!\mathbb{R}$ whose model parameters $\headP{\GC}$ are randomly initialized.
For input features $x$, by using the pretrained backbone encoder $\enc{\encP}$, the probability of GC is predicted by applying the sigmoid function $\sigma$ to the logit $\head{\GC}(\enc{\encP}(x))$ (i.e., $\sigma(\head{\GC}(\enc{\encP}(x)))$).
Let $\pretrainP$ denote the pretrained model parameters of backbone encoder.
For fine-tuning, we first initialize the model parameters of backbone $\encP$ to $\pretrainP$, and then jointly optimize the backbone $\enc{\encP}$ and the GC head $\head{\GC}$ by minimizing the weighted BCE for the GC dataset:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ft_obj}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ft}}(\phi,\headP{\GC}) = \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim \mathcal{D}_{\GC}}\!\big[\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(\head{\GC}(\enc{\pretrainP}(x)),y;\alpha)\big]\;+\;\ftDecayC \big( \|\phi\|_2^2 + \|\headP{\GC}\|_2^2 \big),
\end{equation}
where we use positive-class weight $\alpha{=}3$ and $\ftDecayC$ is the $\ell_2$-regularization coefficient for fine-tuning.

%% TODO: cite Adam
%For pretraining and fine-tuning phases, we optimize model parameters using the Adam optimizer with separate learning rates and $\ell_2$-regularization coefficients $\preDecayC$ and $\ftDecayC$.
%The mini-batch size is set to $\lfloor 0.2 \cdot N_c \rfloor$ capped to $[8,64]$ where $N_c$ is the data size for cancer type $c \in \{\CC,\EC,\LC,\PC,\GC\}$.
%All tasks share the positive-class weight $\alpha = 3$ in $\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}$.

%TODO: move the below in the section of experimental results?
%Decision thresholds are chosen on the validation set by maximizing $F_1$:
%\begin{equation}
%t^\star=\arg\max_{t\in[0,1]}\ \frac{2\,\mathrm{Precision}(t)\cdot\mathrm{Recall}(t)}{\mathrm{Precision}(t)+\mathrm{Recall}(t)}.
%\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Baselines (Non-transfer)}
We benchmark three widely used non-transfer families that reflect complementary inductive biases for structured EHR data \citep{EHRBreastRecurrence2023,WANG2023Prostate,park2024SHapley}. To avoid conflating modeling choices with pretraining, all baselines use the identical feature set, preprocessing, and stratified data splits as the Transfer MLP.

\subparagraph{Logistic Regression (LR)}
A linear probabilistic classifier that models the log-odds of GC as an affine function of the inputs, offering a strong, interpretable tabular baseline. LR captures additive effects and provides well-calibrated risk estimates under mild assumptions, making it a common comparator in clinical prediction studies.

\subparagraph{eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)}
An ensemble of decision trees trained by gradient boosting to approximate non-linear decision boundaries and higher-order feature interactions on tabular data. This class of models is competitive on EHR tasks due to its flexibility with mixed-scale features and robustness to outliers and sparse signals.

\subparagraph{MLP trained from scratch (MLP)}
To isolate the effect of transfer learning, we also evaluate a multilayer perceptron that is \emph{architecturally identical} to the Transfer MLP’s backbone and GC head (linear blocks with batch normalization, ReLU, and dropout), and uses the \emph{same} training objective, mini-batch formulation, and regularization as in fine-tuning. The only difference is that the pretraining stage on non-GC cancer datasets is \emph{omitted}: all parameters are randomly initialized and optimized solely on the GC dataset. Conceptually, this baseline serves as an \emph{ablation} of the Transfer MLP in which the pretraining component is removed; thus, any performance gap directly quantifies the benefit of transfer.


\subsection{Statistical Analysis}
%In imbalanced settings, AP is often more informative than AUROC~\citep{Saito2015_PR}.
For each cancer type, we first divided the subjects into training and test sets, using an 85\%--15\% split. 
We further split the training set so that 20\% of it was used as a validation set. 
In all splits, stratified sampling was performed to ensure that the proportion of cases and controls remained consistent across the training, validation, and test sets. 
For a given hyperparameter setting, we trained model parameters using the training set, and computed the model performances for the validation and test sets. 
The evaluation metrics included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), average precision (AP), sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. 
This entire procedure was repeated 10 times with different data splits. 
To optimize hyperparameters, we computed the mean AUROC on the validation set across these repetitions and selected hyperparameters based on this mean AUROC. 
The final model performance was then evaluated on the independent test split, and we report the mean performance across the 10 repetitions as the final test result.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Cohort Overview}
We constructed case--control cohorts for GC (target) and four source cancers (CC, EC, LC, PC) at a 1:3 ratio.
Table~\ref{tab:cohort} summarizes sample sizes and demographics.
Across cohorts, the sex distribution was approximately balanced (overall $\sim$51\% male) and the age distribution was comparable, with medians centered near 55--56 years and interquartile ranges spanning the mid-30s to around 70 years. 
Within the pretraining pool, EC constitutes the smallest cohort (529 cases, 1{,}587 controls), whereas CC and PC provide the largest case counts (2{,}020 and 1{,}958, respectively), with LC intermediate (1{,}771). 
In aggregate, the non-GC sources contribute 6{,}278 cases and 18{,}834 controls, compared with 731 and 2{,}193 for GC; thus, the pretraining pool supplies $\sim$8.6$\times$ more labeled samples than the GC task alone. 
This size differential is pertinent for transfer learning, as it enables the backbone to learn cancer-agnostic structure from richer supervision before adaptation to GC.

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
As summarized in Table~\ref{tab:model-compare-gc1}, the Transfer model achieved the highest discrimination and precision–recall performance, outperforming strong non-transfer baselines.
The Transfer model achieved the best overall discrimination (AUROC $0.938$, 95\% CI $0.933$–$0.943$) and precision--recall performance (AP $0.826$), exceeding the non-transfer MLP trained from scratch (AUROC $0.930$ [0.925–0.934], AP $0.811$), XGB (AUROC $0.928$, AP $0.806$), and LR (AUROC $0.921$, AP $0.780$).
Relative to the scratch MLP, transfer learning improved AUROC by $+0.008$ and AP by $+0.015$, with a favorable operating profile (sensitivity $0.890$, specificity $0.838$, $F_1=0.751$). These gains suggest that pretraining on related non-GC cancers yields more informative representations for GC risk, translating into small but consistent improvements over the baselines.
