\section{Introduction}
Gastric cancer (GC) continues to pose a major challenge to global health, 
ranking as the fifth most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide~\cite{park2024SHapley}. 
Prognosis remains strongly dependent on the stage at diagnosis, 
with 5-year survival rates exceeding 70\% for localized disease but dropping below 10\% for metastatic GC~\cite{NCI2023stomach}.

Harnessing routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data for earlier GC identification could improve outcomes by enabling timely endoscopy and treatment.
Structured EHR signals—such as demographics, diagnoses, and laboratory data—represent an attractive source for data-driven cancer screening~\cite{read2023cancers,huang2022jco}.
However, EHR-based model development can face persistent challenges, including incomplete or missing records, irregular sampling intervals, and the overall complexity of clinical documentation.
Moreover, ethical and regulatory requirements—such as institutional approvals or patient consent—can further limit the volume of analyzable data, 
leading to relatively small, heterogeneous datasets for model training.
% TODO: citation

\paragraph{Why pre-train on CC/EC/LC/PC for GC?}
We pre-train on non-gastric GI/HPB cancers that exhibit the \emph{same EHR-visible lab signatures} used for GC detection, so learned representations transfer to GC. 
(\textbf{CC/EC}$\!\to\!$\textbf{GC})
Luminal gastrointestinal (GI) tumors share occult bleeding $\Rightarrow$ iron-deficiency anemia with characteristic CBC shifts~\cite{read2023cancers,Aksoy2019CBC,Krieg2024IDA,Kim2014GIBleed}. 
(\textbf{LC}$\!\to\!$\textbf{GC}) Anemia and inflammation/nutritional axes (e.g., albumin, CRP, NLR/PLR) are prominent in liver disease/cancer and are also strong GC biomarkers~\cite{Stein2016Anemia,Gkamprela2017CLDIDA,Crumley2010Albumin,Kim2020Inflam}. 
(\textbf{PC}$\!\to\!$\textbf{GC}) Dysglycemia/diabetes—frequent in PC—also stratifies GC risk; encoders trained on glucose/HbA1c dynamics improve GC representation learning without implying causation~\cite{Shimoyama2013DMGC,Yoon2013DMGC,Guo2022DMGC}.


\paragraph{왜 GC를 위해 CC/EC/LC/PC로 사전학습하는가?}
우리는 위암(GC) 탐지에 사용되는 것과 \emph{동일한 EHR 상의 검사실 징후(lab signatures)}를 나타내는 비(非)위장관(GI)/간담췌(HPB)계 암(CC/EC/LC/PC)을 대상으로 사전학습을 수행함으로써, 학습된 표현이 GC에 전이될 수 있도록 하였다.  
(\textbf{CC/EC}$\!\to\!$\textbf{GC}) 장관(luminal GI) 종양들은 잠재적 출혈(occult bleeding)을 공유하며, 이는 철결핍성 빈혈로 이어지고 특징적인 CBC(전혈검사) 변화로 나타난다~\cite{read2023cancers,Aksoy2019CBC,Krieg2024IDA,Kim2014GIBleed}.  
(\textbf{LC}$\!\to\!$\textbf{GC}) 간 질환 및 간암에서는 빈혈, 염증, 영양 관련 축(예: 알부민, CRP, NLR/PLR)이 두드러지며, 이러한 축들은 GC에서도 강력한 생체표지자(biomarkers)로 작용한다~\cite{Stein2016Anemia,Gkamprela2017CLDIDA,Crumley2010Albumin,Kim2020Inflam}.  
(\textbf{PC}$\!\to\!$\textbf{GC}) 췌장암(PC)에서 흔히 관찰되는 혈당 이상/당뇨(dysglycemia/diabetes)는 GC 위험을 구분하는 인자이기도 하며, 포도당·HbA1c 변화(dynamic)를 학습한 인코더는 인과관계를 암시하지 않더라도 GC 표현 학습을 향상시킬 수 있다~\cite{Shimoyama2013DMGC,Yoon2013DMGC,Guo2022DMGC}.


\paragraph{왜 GC를 위해 CC/EC/LC/PC로 사전학습하는가?}
우리는 위암(GC)을 탐지하는 데 실제로 사용되는 \emph{동일한 EHR 가시적 시그니처(EHR-visible signatures)}를 나타내는 비(非)위암 데이터(즉, CC/EC/LC/PC)에서 사전학습(pre-train)을 수행한다.  
이렇게 하면 이러한 암들로부터 학습된 표현(representation)이 GC로 전이(transfer)될 수 있다.

\textbf{(1) CC \& EC $\rightarrow$ GC: 공통된 잠혈(occult bleeding) → IDA/CBC 패턴.}  
위암은 대개 만성적인 잠혈로 인한 철결핍성 빈혈(IDA)과 특유의 CBC(혈구계산) 변화를 동반한다.  
이는 대장암(CC)과 식도암(EC)에서도 동일한 기전으로 나타나므로, CC/EC 데이터를 이용해 CBC 기반 인코더를 학습하면 GC에도 일반화된다~\cite{read2023cancers,Aksoy2019CBC,Krieg2024IDA,AGA2024IDA,Kim2014GIBleed}.

\textbf{(2) LC $\rightarrow$ GC: 공통된 빈혈 및 염증/영양 축.}  
빈혈과 전신 염증(예: 알부민 저하, CRP 상승; NLR/PLR 비율)은 간질환/간암(LC)에서 흔하며, GC에서도 강력한 바이오마커로 작용한다.  
따라서 LC에서 사전학습을 수행하면 이러한 검사 축(laboratory axes)으로부터의 안정적인 매핑을 학습하게 되어 GC 판별 성능이 향상된다~\cite{Stein2016Anemia,Gkamprela2017CLDIDA,Crumley2010Albumin,Kim2020Inflam}.

\textbf{(3) PC $\rightarrow$ GC: GC 위험을 조절하는 혈당/대사 시그니처.}  
당뇨병 또는 이상혈당(dysglycemia)은 흔한 공존 질환이며 위암의 \emph{위험 요인}으로 여러 메타분석에서 일관되게 보고되어 있다.  
따라서 PC 데이터에서 포도당, HbA1c, 인슐린 패턴을 해석하도록 학습된 인코더는, 혈당 상태가 위험도와 교란(confounding)을 강하게 구분하는 GC 코호트에서도 잘 전이된다~\cite{Shimoyama2013DMGC,Yoon2013DMGC,Guo2022DMGC}.  
중요한 점은, 우리는 췌장암(PC)이 GC를 \emph{유발한다}고 주장하는 것이 아니라, PC 사전학습을 통해 GC에서도 중요한 혈당 관련 시계열 변화를 더 잘 인식할 수 있게 된다는 것이다.

이러한 연관성 덕분에 사전학습은 CBC, 알부민/CRP, 혈당 등과 같은 \emph{GC 발현에 인과적이거나 임상적으로 근접한(lab-time series structure)} 시계열 구조를 학습하게 되며, 이는 이후 GC 파인튜닝(fine-tuning)에 유익하게 작용한다.



\paragraph{Why pre-train on CC/EC/LC/PC for GC?}
We pre-train on non-gastric cancers that express \emph{the same EHR-visible signatures actually used to detect GC}, so that representations learned from those cancers transfer to GC.

\textbf{(1) CC \& EC $\rightarrow$ GC: shared occult bleeding $\Rightarrow$ IDA/CBC patterns.}
GC commonly presents with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) and characteristic CBC shifts from chronic occult bleeding, the same mechanism seen in colorectal and esophageal cancers; thus CBC-based encoders trained on CC/EC generalize to GC~\cite{read2023cancers,Aksoy2019CBC,Krieg2024IDA,AGA2024IDA,Kim2014GIBleed}.

\textbf{(2) LC $\rightarrow$ GC: shared anemia \& inflammation/nutrition axes.}
Anemia and systemic inflammation (e.g., low albumin, elevated CRP; NLR/PLR) are prevalent in liver disease/cancer and are also strong GC biomarkers; pre-training on LC teaches robust mappings from these lab axes that improve GC discrimination~\cite{Stein2016Anemia,Gkamprela2017CLDIDA,Crumley2010Albumin,Kim2020Inflam}.

\textbf{(3) PC $\rightarrow$ GC: glycemic/metabolic signatures that modulate GC risk.}
Diabetes/dysglycemia is a frequent co-morbidity and a \emph{risk factor} for GC (modest but consistent in meta-analyses); encoders trained to parse glucose/HbA1c/insulin patterns in PC transfer to GC cohorts where glycemic status strongly stratifies risk and confounding~\cite{Shimoyama2013DMGC,Yoon2013DMGC,Guo2022DMGC}.
Crucially, we do \emph{not} claim PC causes GC; rather, PC pre-training improves recognition of glycemic lab dynamics that \emph{also matter for GC}.

These links ensure that pre-training extracts lab-time–series structure (CBC, albumin/CRP, glycemia) that is \emph{causally or clinically proximal} to GC presentation and hence beneficial for GC fine-tuning.


Transfer learning provides a strategy to mitigate data scarcity by reusing knowledge learned on related tasks.
In EHR-based oncology research, phenotypes across gastrointestinal and hepatopancreatobiliary cancers often share common risk factors, laboratory patterns, and diagnostic trajectories.
We therefore explore a cross-cancer transfer learning paradigm: train a shared backbone on non-gastric cancers and adapt it to GC via fine-tuning.
We evaluate this hypothesis in the MIMIC-IV v3.1 critical care database \citep{Johnson2024MIMICIV}, building models that use only structured data to avoid features that merely encode physician suspicion.

%Our contributions are threefold:
%(i) a multi-head transfer MLP with structural-parameter (L2-SP) regularization \citep{li2018l2sp} and controllable fine-tuning heads (including logit averaging) to stabilize adaptation; and
%(ii) a rigorous, seed-repeated selection protocol that fixes model choice by validation AUROC and then reports both validation and held-out test metrics with sensitivity/specificity/F1 at a validation-optimized threshold \citep{davis2006relationship,saito2015precision}.

%To test this hypothesis, we developed a reproducible pipeline on the MIMIC-IV v3.1 database to construct cohorts, engineer biologically meaningful features, and train several baseline models along with a transfer-learning multilayer perceptron (Transfer-MLP). The Transfer-MLP is pretrained on non-GC GI cancers (colorectal, liver, esophageal, pancreatic) and then fine-tuned on GC labels using a controlled head-selection strategy and structural parameter (SP) regularization. Our contributions are: (i) a transparent, fully code-driven cohort construction and feature engineering workflow that avoids features merely encoding physicians' suspicion; (ii) a multi-head transfer architecture that supports different fine-tuning strategies; and (iii) an empirical demonstration that pretraining on related cancers improves early GC prediction compared with GC-only training.


\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Data Source and Ethics}
We used the publicly available de-identified MIMIC-IV clinical database (v3.1) \citep{Johnson2024MIMICIV}.
Access to the database was granted to our research team, and we adhered to all usage agreements, including the prohibition of data disclosure and misuse.

\subsection{Cohort Construction and Features}
{\color{red}
In addition to the GC cohort, we deliberately constructed pre-training cohorts for four non-GC cancers—\textbf{CC} (colorectal), \textbf{EC} (esophageal), \textbf{LC} (liver), and \textbf{PC} (pancreatic)—because they express EHR-detectable signatures shared with GC (occult blood loss/IDA in luminal GI; anemia with chronic liver disease and HCC; dysglycemia and metabolic-syndrome signals in pancreatic cancer)~\citep{read2023cancers,Hamilton2008CRC,StatPearls2024Esoph,Stein2016AnemiaLiver,Gkamprela2017IDAinCLD,NCI2021NODPC,Zhong2023MetS_PC,MetS_CRC_2021}.

In this study, we constructed cohorts not only for gastric cancer (GC) but also for multiple non-GC cancers (colorectal, esophageal, liver, and pancreatic).
This design emphasizes that our approach leverages diverse cancer types for pre-training before fine-tuning on GC.
Throughout, we use the codes to denote cancer types: \textbf{GC} = gastric cancer (target task), \textbf{CC} = colorectal cancer, \textbf{EC} = esophageal cancer, \textbf{LC} = liver cancer, and \textbf{PC} = pancreatic cancer.}

For each cancer, we identified cases by the earliest qualifying ICD-9/10 diagnosis and sampled controls at a fixed $1{:}3$ case:control ratio, excluding subjects with the target cancer.
The GC index time $t_G$ is the first GC diagnosis; for non-GC cancers $c\in\{\mathrm{CC},\mathrm{EC},\mathrm{LC},\mathrm{PC}\}$ we analogously define $t_c$.
Features include demographics (age, sex), binary ICD-derived comorbidity indicators (e.g., diabetes, GERD, ulcers), and the most recent values of routine laboratory tests (CBC/chemistry) in a $\pm 30$-day window around the index time (or all available values for controls).
Identical preprocessing is applied to cases and controls; numerical features are standardized by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance using statistics on the training split only.

To address missing values, we applied median imputation based on the control population. 
For each feature, the median value observed among the controls was calculated and substituted for missing entries across both cases and controls. 
This strategy minimizes information leakage from the case group and provides a robust central tendency measure for imputation.
[[TODO: finally used feature list ]]



\paragraph{Final feature set used for modeling.}
After removing identifier/time columns and a small list of prespecified exclusions, the final input vector $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$ comprised:

%\subsection{Feature Engineering}
%We engineered features that are interpretable and clinically plausible. Demographics included age and sex. Binary ICD-derived comorbidity indicators were computed for clinically relevant conditions (e.g., diabetes, obesity, GERD, dyspepsia, gastric ulcer, alcohol/tobacco use, anemia, malnutrition, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, lipid disorders). For laboratory features, we included the most recent value per analyte within a symmetric look-back window around the index date (or all available values for controls), covering complete blood count indices and common chemistries (e.g., hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV/MCH/MCHC, WBC and differentials, platelets, RDW; sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, anion gap). Missing values were imputed and missingness flags optionally dropped after imputation. Non-predictive index-related variables were excluded from modeling.


\subsection{Models}
% === NEW: put this at the start of the Models section ===
%\subsection{Study Objective: Quantifying the Benefit of Transfer}
Our primary objective is to \textbf{quantify how much transfer learning from non-gastric cancers improves early prediction of gastric cancer (GC)}. 
We therefore compare models \emph{trained only on GC (non-transfer baselines)} against models that \emph{first pre-train on multiple non-GC cancers and then fine-tune on GC (transfer)}.
To isolate the effect of transfer, we enforce identical feature sets and preprocessing, and stratified data splits across methods. 



\subsubsection{Transfer MLP (Multi-Head).}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ denote the set of \emph{non-gastric} cancers used for pretraining; in our main configuration, $\mathcal{C}=\{\CC,\EC,\LC,\PC\}$ (i.e., colorectal, esophageal, liver, and pancreatic cancers, respectively).
For each $c\in\mathcal{C}$, let $\mathcal{D}_c=\{(x_i^{(c)},y_i^{(c)})\}_{i=1}^{N_c}$ be the corresponding case--control dataset (identical feature space across $c$), constructed with a case--control ratio of $1{:}3$ (one case per three controls).
Here $y\in\{0,1\}$ indicates the disease status for cancer type $c$ ($y{=}1$ for \emph{case} with a confirmed diagnosis of type $c$, and $y{=}0$ for a \emph{control} without that diagnosis).

Our deep learning model consists of a shared backbone encoder $f_\phi:\mathbb{R}^{d_{\mathrm{in}}}\!\to\!\mathbb{R}^{d_h}$ with model parameters $\phi$ and cancer-specific linear heads $\{h_{\theta_c}\}_{c\in\mathcal{C}}$ acting on the latent representation $u=f_\phi(x)$ for input features $x$.
Each head with model parameters $\theta_c=(w_c,b_c)\in\mathbb{R}^{d_h}\times\mathbb{R}$ is an affine map parameterized as
\[
h_{\theta_c}(u)=\langle w_c,u\rangle + b_c,
\]
and produces a logit $z_c(x)=h_{\theta_c}(f_\phi(x))$.
The backbone encoder $f_\phi$ is a feed-forward network with linear blocks, batch normalization \citep{Ioffe2015_BN}, ReLU, and dropout~\citep{Srivastava2014_Dropout}.

We first define the class-weighted binary cross-entropy (BCE) used throughout.
Let $\sigma(t)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-t)}$ denote the logistic sigmoid.
Given a logit $z\in\mathbb{R}$ and a binary label $y\in\{0,1\}$, the per-sample loss is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:bce}
  \ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(z,y;\alpha)
  = -\,\alpha\,y\log \sigma(z)\;-\;(1-y)\log\!\big(1-\sigma(z)\big),
  \end{equation}
where $\alpha>0$ is the positive-class weight; in our experiments we set $\alpha=3$ to match the $1{:}3$ case--control sampling design.
%TODO: cite: class-weighted BCE?

During pretraining, we jointly optimize the backbone $f_\phi$ and all cancer-specific heads $\Theta_h\!=\!\{\theta_c\}_{c\in\mathcal{C}}$ by minimizing the mean of the weighted BCE over cancer types:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|}\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}}
  \ \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim\mathcal{D}_c}\!\big[\,\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(h_{\theta_c}(f_\phi(x)),y;\alpha)\,\big],
\end{equation}
with positive-class weight $\alpha{=}3$. 
To reduce overfitting, we applied standard $\ell_2$-regularization
(weight decay) with coefficient $\preDecayC$.
Thus, the pretraining objective is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pre_obj}
%  \min_{\phi,\Theta_h}\ 
  \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{pre}}(\phi,\Theta_h)
  = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|}\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}}
  \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim\mathcal{D}_c}\!\big[\,\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(h_{\theta_c}(f_\phi(x)),y;\alpha)\,\big]
  + \preDecayC \big( \|\phi\|_2^2 + \sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}} \|\theta_c\|_2^2 \big).
\end{equation}

In practice, model training does not update the parameters using the entire dataset at once, but rather processes smaller subsets of data called \emph{mini-batches}. 
A mini-batch is simply a small group of samples (e.g., a few dozen patients) drawn from the full dataset, and the model parameters are updated based on the gradient of the loss function computed by using only that group. 
This strategy reduces memory requirements and stabilizes optimization compared to using a single sample (stochastic updates) or the full dataset (full-batch updates).
During pretraining, at each optimization step we draw one mini-batch $B_c$ from \emph{each} cancer type $c\in\mathcal{C}$ and compute their respective losses. 
The pretraining loss for a step is then obtained by averaging over all cancer types:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pre_mix}
  \hat{\mathcal{L}}_{\mathrm{pre}}(\phi,\Theta_h)
  =\frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|}\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}}\ \frac{1}{|B_c|}\!
  \sum_{(x,y)\in B_c}\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(h_{\theta_c}(f_\phi(x)),y;\alpha) 
  + \preDecayC \Big( \|\phi\|_2^2 + \sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}} \|\theta_c\|_2^2 \Big).
\end{equation}
In this way, each cancer-specific head $h_{\theta_c}$ is trained using its own mini-batch, while the backbone encoder $f_\phi$ receives gradients aggregated across cancers, encouraging it to learn shared representations.

\textit{Expected effect.} Type-balanced, multi-task pretraining (\cref{eq:pre_obj,eq:pre_mix}) is expected to (i) induce cancer-agnostic risk representations in $f_\phi$, (ii) improve sample efficiency and stabilize optimization when fine-tuning on gastric cancer with limited labels, and (iii) mitigate label-imbalance effects through the weighted loss in \cref{eq:bce}.
These mechanisms are consistent with established benefits of multi-task learning and transfer learning~\citep{Caruana1997_MTL,Pan2010_TLsurvey,Yosinski2014_transferable,He2009_Imbalanced}.

For training the prediction model for GC, we introduce new GC linear head $\head{\GC}:\mathbb{R}^{d_{h}}\!\to\!\mathbb{R}$ whose model parameters $\headP{\GC}$ are randomly initialized.
For input features $x$, by using the pretrained backbone encoder $\enc{\encP}$, the probability of GC is predicted by applying the sigmoid function $\sigma$ to the logit $\head{\GC}(\enc{\encP}(x))$ (i.e., $\sigma(\head{\GC}(\enc{\encP}(x)))$).
Let $\pretrainP$ denote the pretrained model parameters of backbone encoder.
For fine-tuning, we first initialize the model parameters of backbone $\encP$ to $\pretrainP$, and then jointly optimize the backbone $\enc{\encP}$ and the GC head $\head{\GC}$ by minimizing the weighted BCE for the GC dataset:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ft_obj}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ft}}(\phi,\headP{\GC}) = \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim \mathcal{D}_{\GC}}\!\big[\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(\head{\GC}(\enc{\pretrainP}(x)),y;\alpha)\big]\;+\;\ftDecayC \big( \|\phi\|_2^2 + \|\headP{\GC}\|_2^2 \big),
\end{equation}
where we use positive-class weight $\alpha{=}3$ and $\ftDecayC$ is the $\ell_2$-regularization coefficient for fine-tuning.

%% TODO: cite Adam
%For pretraining and fine-tuning phases, we optimize model parameters using the Adam optimizer with separate learning rates and $\ell_2$-regularization coefficients $\preDecayC$ and $\ftDecayC$.
%The mini-batch size is set to $\lfloor 0.2 \cdot N_c \rfloor$ capped to $[8,64]$ where $N_c$ is the data size for cancer type $c \in \{\CC,\EC,\LC,\PC,\GC\}$.
%All tasks share the positive-class weight $\alpha = 3$ in $\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}$.

%TODO: move the below in the section of experimental results?
%Decision thresholds are chosen on the validation set by maximizing $F_1$:
%\begin{equation}
%t^\star=\arg\max_{t\in[0,1]}\ \frac{2\,\mathrm{Precision}(t)\cdot\mathrm{Recall}(t)}{\mathrm{Precision}(t)+\mathrm{Recall}(t)}.
%\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Baselines (Non-transfer)}
We benchmark three widely used non-transfer families that reflect complementary inductive biases for structured EHR data \citep{EHRBreastRecurrence2023,WANG2023Prostate,park2024SHapley}. To avoid conflating modeling choices with pretraining, all baselines use the identical feature set, preprocessing, and stratified data splits as the Transfer MLP.

\subparagraph{Logistic Regression (LR)}
A linear probabilistic classifier that models the log-odds of GC as an affine function of the inputs, offering a strong, interpretable tabular baseline. LR captures additive effects and provides well-calibrated risk estimates under mild assumptions, making it a common comparator in clinical prediction studies.

\subparagraph{Gradient-Boosted Trees (XGBoost)}
An ensemble of decision trees trained by gradient boosting to approximate non-linear decision boundaries and higher-order feature interactions on tabular data. This class of models is competitive on EHR tasks due to its flexibility with mixed-scale features and robustness to outliers and sparse signals.

\subparagraph{MLP trained from scratch (Non-transfer MLP)}
To isolate the effect of transfer learning, we also evaluate a multilayer perceptron that is \emph{architecturally identical} to the Transfer MLP’s backbone and GC head (linear blocks with batch normalization, ReLU, and dropout), and uses the \emph{same} training objective, mini-batch formulation, and regularization as in fine-tuning. The only difference is that the pretraining stage on non-GC cancer datasets is \emph{omitted}: all parameters are randomly initialized and optimized solely on the GC dataset. Conceptually, this baseline serves as an \emph{ablation} of the Transfer MLP in which the pretraining component is removed; thus, any performance gap directly quantifies the benefit of transfer.


\subsection{Statistical Analysis}
%In imbalanced settings, AP is often more informative than AUROC~\citep{Saito2015_PR}.
For each cancer type, we first divided the subjects into training and test sets, using an 85\%--15\% split. 
We further split the training set so that 20\% of it was used as a validation set. 
In all splits, stratified sampling was performed to ensure that the proportion of cases and controls remained consistent across the training, validation, and test sets. 
For a given hyperparameter setting, we trained model parameters using the training set, and computed the model performances for the validation and test sets. 
The evaluation metrics included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), average precision (AP), sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. 
This entire procedure was repeated 10 times with different data splits. 
To optimize hyperparameters, we computed the mean AUROC on the validation set across these repetitions and selected hyperparameters based on this mean AUROC. 
The final model performance was then evaluated on the independent test split, and we report the mean performance across the 10 repetitions as the final test result.
