\section{Introduction}
Gastric cancer (GC) continues to pose a major challenge to global health, being the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide \cite{sung2021global}. 
Harnessing routinely collected EHR data for earlier GC identification could improve outcomes by enabling timely endoscopy and treatment.
Although structured EHR signals (demographics, diagnoses, laboratories) are attractive for scalable screening,
however, EHR data suitable for model development may be hard to collect due to multiple reasons: incomplete or missing records, irregular sampling and follow-up patterns, and the overall complexity of clinical documentation.
Moreover, ethical and regulatory requirements—such as the necessity of obtaining patient consent or institutional approvals—can further restrict the availability of usable data.
As a result, the number of patients that can be effectively included for model training may remain limited.
% TODO: citation

Transfer learning provides a strategy to mitigate data scarcity by reusing knowledge learned on related tasks.
In EHR oncology, phenotypes across gastrointestinal and hepatopancreatobiliary cancers can share risk factors, laboratory patterns, and diagnosis trajectories.
We therefore explore a cross-cancer pretraining paradigm: train a shared backbone on non-gastric cancers and adapt it to GC via fine-tuning.
We evaluate this hypothesis in the MIMIC-IV v3.1 critical care database \citep{Johnson2024MIMICIV}, building models that use only structured data to avoid features that merely encode physician suspicion.

%Our contributions are threefold:
%(i) a multi-head transfer MLP with structural-parameter (L2-SP) regularization \citep{li2018l2sp} and controllable fine-tuning heads (including logit averaging) to stabilize adaptation; and
%(ii) a rigorous, seed-repeated selection protocol that fixes model choice by validation AUROC and then reports both validation and held-out test metrics with sensitivity/specificity/F1 at a validation-optimized threshold \citep{davis2006relationship,saito2015precision}.

%To test this hypothesis, we developed a reproducible pipeline on the MIMIC-IV v3.1 database to construct cohorts, engineer biologically meaningful features, and train several baseline models along with a transfer-learning multilayer perceptron (Transfer-MLP). The Transfer-MLP is pretrained on non-GC GI cancers (colorectal, liver, esophageal, pancreatic) and then fine-tuned on GC labels using a controlled head-selection strategy and structural parameter (SP) regularization. Our contributions are: (i) a transparent, fully code-driven cohort construction and feature engineering workflow that avoids features merely encoding physicians' suspicion; (ii) a multi-head transfer architecture that supports different fine-tuning strategies; and (iii) an empirical demonstration that pretraining on related cancers improves early GC prediction compared with GC-only training.


{\color{red}
Gastric cancer (GC) continues to pose a major challenge to global health, being the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer and the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide \citep{sung2021global}. Harnessing routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data for earlier GC identification could improve outcomes by enabling timely endoscopy and treatment.

In practice, however, assembling EHR datasets that are truly usable for model development can be difficult. For GC in particular, early-stage cases are relatively uncommon in routine care pathways; clinical records can be incomplete or missing; follow-up and sampling are often irregular; and clinical documentation is complex and heterogeneous. In addition, ethical and regulatory safeguards---for example, the need for institutional approvals and, in some settings, patient consent---can further constrain the availability of analyzable patient-level data. As a result, the number of patients that can be effectively included for model training may remain limited.

Transfer learning offers a principled way to mitigate data scarcity by reusing structure learned from related tasks. In gastrointestinal oncology, non-gastric cancers (e.g., colorectal, liver, esophageal, pancreatic) share overlapping comorbidity profiles and laboratory patterns. We therefore explore a cross-cancer pretraining paradigm: train a shared backbone on non-gastric cancers and adapt it to GC via fine-tuning, using only structured EHR features so as not to rely on signals that merely encode physician suspicion. We evaluate this hypothesis in the MIMIC-IV v3.1 critical care database \citep{Johnson2024MIMICIV}.

\section{Related Work}
{
\color{red}
Population-scale screening and claims cohorts have enabled the development of GC risk models using noninvasive, routinely available variables. Using the Korean National Health Insurance Service screening data (2013--2014) with 10{,}515{,}949 adults and 5-year follow-up, Park et~al.\ trained several algorithms and found that logistic regression achieved the highest discrimination (internal AUROC 0.708; external AUROC 0.669); they further applied SHAP to highlight age, sex, \textit{Helicobacter pylori} infection, smoking, and family history as the top contributors \citep{park2024crt}. Class imbalance was addressed via ROSE oversampling, and multiple imputation (MICE) supported robustness analyses \citep{park2024crt}.

A complementary line of work develops EHR-only models that avoid endoscopy/pathology so they can be deployed to broader US populations. Kim et~al.\ built a multivariable logistic regression model for noncardia GC (NCGC) using a large multi-state EHR; after multiple imputation, the 0.632 estimator of AUC was 0.731. They reported threshold-dependent operating points (e.g., specificity $\approx90\%$ at PPV $\approx1\%$) and discussed pragmatic EHR limitations such as missingness and the poor capture of key risk factors (e.g., H.\ pylori, alcohol use) \citep{kim2024gastha}.

Methodologically, the relative merits of classical models vs.\ machine learning on EHR have been investigated. In two independent EHR systems (Stanford, University of Washington), Huang et~al.\ compared logistic regression to lasso, SVM, k-nearest neighbors, and random forests for NCGC risk classification. Across internal and external validation, logistic regression performed comparably to optimized ML models, underscoring the value of well-specified, interpretable models when data are heterogeneous and partially missing \citep{huang2022jco}. They also detailed the practical burden of phenotyping from unstructured notes and the sensitivity of results to feature availability \citep{huang2022jco}.

Our study differs from the above in two ways. First, we do not rely on endoscopic or pathology-derived features, focusing instead on structured EHR signals. Second, we leverage a transfer-learning strategy that \emph{pretrains} on non-gastric gastrointestinal cancers and \emph{fine-tunes} on GC, thereby exploiting cross-cancer regularities to improve representation learning under GC data constraints.

\section{Materials and Methods}

\subsection{Data Source and Ethics}
We used the publicly available de-identified MIMIC-IV clinical database (v3.1) \citep{Johnson2024MIMICIV}.
Access to the database was granted to our research team, and we adhered to all usage agreements, including the prohibition of data disclosure and misuse.

\subsection{Cohort Construction and Features}
In this study, we constructed cohorts not only for gastric cancer (GC) but also for multiple non-GC cancers (colorectal, esophageal, liver, and pancreatic).
This design emphasizes that our approach leverages diverse cancer types for pre-training before fine-tuning on GC.
Throughout, we use the codes to denote cancer types: \textbf{GC} = gastric cancer (target task), \textbf{CC} = colorectal cancer, \textbf{EC} = esophageal cancer, \textbf{LC} = liver cancer, and \textbf{PC} = pancreatic cancer.

For each cancer, we identified cases by the earliest qualifying ICD-9/10 diagnosis (prefix lists for GC and four non-GC cancers) and sampled controls at a fixed $1{:}3$ case:control ratio, excluding subjects with the target cancer.
The GC index time $t_G$ is the first GC diagnosis; for non-GC cancers $c\in\{\mathrm{CC},\mathrm{EC},\mathrm{LC},\mathrm{PC}\}$ we analogously define $t_c$.
Features include demographics (age, sex), binary ICD-derived comorbidity indicators (e.g., diabetes, GERD, ulcers), and the most recent values of routine laboratory tests (CBC/chemistry) in a $\pm 30$-day window around the index time (or all available values for controls).
Identical preprocessing is applied to cases and controls; numerical features are standardized by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance using statistics on the training split only.

To address missing values, we applied median imputation based on the control population. 
For each feature, the median value observed among the controls was calculated and substituted for missing entries across both cases and controls. 
This strategy minimizes information leakage from the case group and provides a robust central tendency measure for imputation.
[[TODO: finally used feature list ]]



\paragraph{Final feature set used for modeling.}
After removing identifier/time columns and a small list of prespecified exclusions, the final input vector $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$ comprised:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12pt,topsep=2pt,itemsep=1pt]
  \item \textbf{Demographics} (2): \texttt{AGE} (years), \texttt{MALE} (0/1).
  \item \textbf{ICD-derived binary indicators} (26): \texttt{DIABETES}, \texttt{OBESITY}, \texttt{ALCOHOL}, \texttt{SMOKE}, \texttt{GERD}, \texttt{DYSPEPSIA}, \texttt{ULCER}, \texttt{GASTRITIS}, \texttt{HPYLORI}, \texttt{HYPERTENSION}, \texttt{MI\_AP}, \texttt{DYSLIPIDEMIA}, \texttt{GA}, \texttt{FAMILY\_HISTORY\_CANCER}, \texttt{PROTEIN\_CALORIE\_MALNUTRITION}, \texttt{POSTHEMORRHAGIC\_ANEMIA}, \texttt{ADVERSE\_EFFECT\_ANTINEOPLASTIC}, \texttt{DYSPHAGIA}, \texttt{ANTINEOPLASTIC\_CHEMOTHERAPY}, \texttt{ATRIAL\_FIBRILLATION}, \texttt{IRON\_DEFICIENCY\_ANEMIA}, \texttt{KIDNEY\_FAILURE}, \texttt{CORONARY\_ATHEROSCLEROSIS\_NATIVE}, \texttt{ATHEROSCLEROTIC\_HEART\_DISEASE\_NATIVE\_NO\_ANGINA}, \texttt{PURE\_HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA}, \texttt{HYPO\_OSMOLALITY\_HYPONATREMIA}.
  \item \textbf{Laboratory variables} (22): \texttt{HGB}, \texttt{MCV}, \texttt{Bicarbonate}, \texttt{Chloride}, \texttt{Potassium}, \texttt{Sodium}, \texttt{Urea\_Nitrogen}, \texttt{Creatinine}, \texttt{Glucose}, \texttt{Anion\_Gap}, \texttt{Red\_Blood\_Cells}, \texttt{White\_Blood\_Cells}, \texttt{Hematocrit}, \texttt{MCHC}, \texttt{Platelet\_Count}, \texttt{RDW}, \texttt{MCH}, \texttt{Basophils}, \texttt{Eosinophils}, \texttt{Lymphocytes}, \texttt{Monocytes}, \texttt{Neutrophils}.
\end{itemize}



%\subsection{Feature Engineering}
%We engineered features that are interpretable and clinically plausible. Demographics included age and sex. Binary ICD-derived comorbidity indicators were computed for clinically relevant conditions (e.g., diabetes, obesity, GERD, dyspepsia, gastric ulcer, alcohol/tobacco use, anemia, malnutrition, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, lipid disorders). For laboratory features, we included the most recent value per analyte within a symmetric look-back window around the index date (or all available values for controls), covering complete blood count indices and common chemistries (e.g., hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV/MCH/MCHC, WBC and differentials, platelets, RDW; sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, anion gap). Missing values were imputed and missingness flags optionally dropped after imputation. Non-predictive index-related variables were excluded from modeling.


\subsection{Models}
% === NEW: put this at the start of the Models section ===
%\subsection{Study Objective: Quantifying the Benefit of Transfer}
Our primary objective is to \textbf{quantify how much transfer learning from non-gastric cancers improves early prediction of gastric cancer (GC)}. 
We therefore compare models \emph{trained only on GC (non-transfer baselines)} against models that \emph{first pre-train on multiple non-GC cancers and then fine-tune on GC (transfer)}.
To isolate the effect of transfer, we enforce identical feature sets and preprocessing, and stratified data splits across methods. 

\subsubsection{Baselines (Non-transfer).} 
We fit (i) \textbf{Logistic Regression (LR)}; 
(ii) \textbf{Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)}; and 
(iii) a \textbf{scratch MLP} that is \emph{initialized randomly and trained solely on GC}. 
These baselines establish performance without any transfer signal.
% TODO: "establish performance without any transfer signal" <== 이 표현 수정

{\color{red}
\paragraph{Logistic Regression (LR).} With standardized features $\tilde{x}=(x-\mu)/\sigma$, LR models $p_\theta(y = 1\mid x)=\sigma(w^\top \tilde{x}+b)$; parameters minimize class-weighted cross-entropy.

\paragraph{Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).} We use XGBoost with imbalance-aware weighting~\citep{Chen2016_XGBoost}.
}

\subsubsection{Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)}
 A feed-forward network with linear blocks, batch normalization, ReLU, and dropout~\citep{Ioffe2015_BN,Srivastava2014_Dropout}.

\subsubsection{Transfer MLP (Multi-Head).}
We parameterize a shared backbone $f_\phi:\mathbb{R}^d\!\to\!\mathbb{R}^h$ and cancer-specific linear heads $\{h_c:\mathbb{R}^h\!\to\!\mathbb{R}\}_{c\in\mathcal{C}}$, yielding logits $z_c(x)=h_c(f_\phi(x))$. Head strategies for GC are detailed below.

\subsection{Losses, Class Imbalance, and Thresholding}
For a logit $u$ and label $y\in\{0,1\}$, we use
\begin{equation}
\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(u,y;\alpha)=-\alpha\,y\log\sigma(u)-(1-y)\log(1-\sigma(u)),
\end{equation}
with positive-class weight $\alpha{=}3$.
%TODO: move the below in the section of experimental results?
%Decision thresholds are chosen on the validation set by maximizing $F_1$:
%\begin{equation}
%t^\star=\arg\max_{t\in[0,1]}\ \frac{2\,\mathrm{Precision}(t)\cdot\mathrm{Recall}(t)}{\mathrm{Precision}(t)+\mathrm{Recall}(t)}.
%\end{equation}

\subsection{Multi-Cancer Pretraining}\label{sec:pretrain_multi}
Let $\mathcal{C}$ denote the set of \emph{non-gastric} cancers used for pretraining; in our main configuration, $\mathcal{C}=\{\mathrm{C},\mathrm{E},\mathrm{L},\mathrm{P}\}$ (i.e., colorectal, esophageal, liver, and pancreatic cancers, respectively).
For each $c\in\mathcal{C}$, let $\mathcal{D}_c=\{(x_i^{(c)},y_i^{(c)})\}_{i=1}^{N_c}$ be the corresponding case--control dataset, constructed with identical features using a case--control ratio of $1{:}3$ (one case per three controls).
The final linear layer has $|\mathcal{C}|$ outputs during pretraining and is replaced with a new $1$-dimensional head during fine-tuning (to predict GC).



\paragraph{Objective and type-mixed minibatches.}
We minimize the average class-weighted binary cross-entropy over types:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pre_obj}
\min_{\phi,\{h_c\}}\ \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{pre}}(\phi,\{h_c\})=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|}\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}} \ \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim\mathcal{D}_c}\!\big[\,\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(h_c(f_\phi(x)),y;\alpha)\,\big],
\end{equation}
with positive-class weight $\alpha{=}3$. In practice, each optimization step draws one mini-batch $B_c$ from \emph{each} $c\in\mathcal{C}$ and accumulates losses across types:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pre_mix}
\hat{\mathcal{L}}_{\mathrm{pre}}=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|}\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}}\ \frac{1}{|B_c|}\sum_{(x,y)\in B_c}\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(h_c(f_\phi(x)),y;\alpha),
\end{equation}
so that heads specialize while gradients are shared through $f_\phi$.

\paragraph{Validation across types and model selection.}
At regular intervals (every $K$ steps), we evaluate each head on its validation split and report both per-type metrics and their mean:
\begin{equation}
\overline{\mathrm{AUROC}}=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|}\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}}\mathrm{AUROC}_c,\qquad
\overline{\mathrm{AP}}=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|}\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}}\mathrm{AP}_c.
\end{equation}
We retain the snapshot that maximizes $\overline{\mathrm{AUROC}}$ (ties broken by $\overline{\mathrm{AP}}$). The per-type validation metrics $\{(\mathrm{AUROC}_c,\mathrm{AP}_c)\}$ are stored for GC head selection in the \texttt{best} strategy.

\paragraph{Fine-tuning head strategies.}
During GC fine-tuning we use one of three strategies to produce the scalar logit $s(x)$:
\begin{align}
\texttt{avg:}\quad & s(x)=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{C}|}\sum_{c\in\mathcal{C}} z_c(x),\\
\texttt{best:}\quad & s(x)=z_{\hat c}(x),\ \ \hat c=\arg\max_{c\in\mathcal{C}}\big(\mathrm{AUROC}_c,\mathrm{AP}_c\big),\\
\texttt{new:}\quad & s(x)=z_G(x),\ \ \text{extend the last layer to include a new GC head.}
\end{align}
In \texttt{new}, the GC head is randomly initialized; in all modes, the shared backbone is initialized from pretraining.

\paragraph{L2-SP anchoring and trainable sets.}
We regularize the distance to the pretrained parameters $\theta^\star$ using the L2-SP penalty~\citep{Li2018_L2SP}:
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\mathrm{L2\text{-}SP}}(\theta)=\sum_{j\in\mathcal{S}}\|\theta_j-\theta^\star_j\|_2^2,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{S}$ excludes biases; in \texttt{new} we also exclude the expanded final linear layer so that the new GC head is unconstrained. The GC fine-tuning objective is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ft_obj}
\min_{\theta}\ \mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim \mathcal{D}_G}\!\big[\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(s(x),y;\alpha)\big]\;+\;\lambda\,\Omega_{\mathrm{L2\text{-}SP}}(\theta).
\end{equation}
When \texttt{ft\_head\_only} is enabled, a gradient mask restricts updates to the selected row of the final linear layer (the shared backbone runs in inference mode for weight updates).

\paragraph{Batch size, imbalance, and schedules.}
Mini-batch size is either fixed at $64$ or set to $\lfloor \texttt{mb\_rate}\cdot N\rfloor$ (capped to $[8,64]$). All tasks share $\alpha{=}3$ in $\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}$. Adam optimizes both phases with separate learning rates/decays $(\texttt{pre\_lr},\texttt{pre\_weight\_decay})$ and $(\texttt{ft\_lr},\texttt{ft\_weight\_decay})$.

\subparagraph{Summary.}
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=1pt,leftmargin=12pt]
\item Build per-type loaders for each $c\in\mathcal{C}$; initialize $f_\phi$ and $\{h_c\}$.
\item For $t=1\ldots T$: draw one batch from each loader; compute \eqref{eq:pre_mix}; update parameters.
\item Every $K$ steps: compute per-type and mean validation metrics; select the best snapshot.
\item Save weights and per-type metrics; proceed to GC fine-tuning with \texttt{avg}/\texttt{best}/\texttt{new} and (optionally) L2-SP.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Losses, Class Imbalance, and Thresholding}
For a logit $u$ and label $y\in\{0,1\}$, we use
\begin{equation}
\ell_{\mathrm{BCE}}(u,y;\alpha)=-\alpha\,y\log\sigma(u)-(1-y)\log(1-\sigma(u)),
\end{equation}
with positive-class weight $\alpha{=}3$. Decision thresholds are chosen on the validation set by maximizing $F_1$:
\begin{equation}
t^\star=\arg\max_{t\in[0,1]}\ \frac{2\,\mathrm{Precision}(t)\cdot\mathrm{Recall}(t)}{\mathrm{Precision}(t)+\mathrm{Recall}(t)}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Optimization and Early Stopping}
Neural models are optimized with Adam~\citep{Kingma2015_Adam}. Batch normalization and dropout act as regularizers~\citep{Ioffe2015_BN,Srivastava2014_Dropout}. In pretraining, validation is performed every $K$ steps and the best snapshot by $\overline{\mathrm{AUROC}}$ is retained; in fine-tuning, early stopping on validation AUROC is optional.

\subsection{Statistical Analysis}
%In imbalanced settings, AP is often more informative than AUROC~\citep{Saito2015_PR}.
For each cancer type, we first divided the subjects into training and test sets, using an 85\%--15\% split. 
We further split the training set so that 20\% of it was used as a validation set. 
In all splits, stratified sampling was performed to ensure that the proportion of cases and controls remained consistent across the training, validation, and test sets. 
For a given hyperparameter setting, we trained model parameters using the training set, and computed the model performances for the validation and test sets. 
The evaluation metrics included the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), average precision (AP), sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. 
This entire procedure was repeated 10 times with different random seeds, which influence aspects such as parameter initialization and mini-batch sampling, potentially leading to variability in the training process. 
To optimize hyperparameters, we computed the mean AUROC on the validation set across these repetitions and selected hyperparameters based on this mean AUROC. 
The final model performance was then evaluated on the independent test split, and we report the mean performance across the 10 repetitions as the final test result.

Sensitivity, Specificity, and F1 are computed at the validation-selected threshold $t^\star$ that maximizes F1. % (Code refs: Train_MLP/LR/XGB, get_best_f1_threshold)
